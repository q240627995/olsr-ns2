Copyright (C) 2007-2010 Weverton Cordeiro (wevertoncordeiro@gmail.com)

We assume that you have downloaded and unpackaged the allinone distribution of ns2.
Assuming that you have downloaded olsr-x.x.xx.tar.gz to your home folder, execute:

$ tar xzf olsr-x.x.xx.tar.gz
$ cd ns-allinone-x.xx/ns-x.xx/
$ patch -p1 < ~/olsr-x.x.x/olsr.patch

If you haven't installed ns2 yet, then do the following:

$ cd ..
$ ./install

On the other hand, if you are installing UM-OLSR on a running installation of ns2:

$ ./configure
$ make distclean
$ ./configure
$ make

NOTE: code should work on previous versions of ns2, but only patches for the latest ones are provided.
